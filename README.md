# HTML, CSS, JS Files to customize Streamlabs' Streamboss Widget

This repository contains the src files to contribute to development, and the dst files that users need to copy/paste into Streamlabs' Streamboss Widget configuration in order to have a custom healthbar, that lets you choose bosses names and images instead of having your viewers as the bosses.

I'll update the repository's README with instructions and make a YouTube video on how to configure everything.
